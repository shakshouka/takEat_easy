# Welcome to takEateasy

## Why?
TakEat Easy is an app that helps you create a randomly generated week meal planning in regards to your profile and gives you a grocery list. This helps you fight against food waste and disorganization in your meal preparations.

## Who?
This app was created by the takEat easy team (Olivier Calmels, Amal Gouia, Georges Sysaath and Alexandre Wotawa) during Le Wagon Bootcamp 501 in November 2020.

## Where?
This app is deployed on Heroku so you may have some delay (about 30s) to load the first page. Your navigation will be fluid then. 

Find this app [here](https://takeat-easy.herokuapp.com/) (www.takeateasy.club) before december 2021.

Or [here](https://takeat-easy.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.

## How?
